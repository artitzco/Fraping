#' Example script for FRAP analysis
#'
#' This function provides an example script for FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) analysis using the 'fraping' package.
#'
#' @details The `test.fraping` function demonstrates how to perform FRAP analysis on a set of data using the 'fraping' package. It includes the necessary steps to load the required libraries, set plot parameters, create data objects, add directories, and generate plots.
#'
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#'   # Run the example script
