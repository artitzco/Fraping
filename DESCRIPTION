Description: The FRAP Analysis Package is designed to handle and interpret data acquired through the Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technique. It provides a set of main functions to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of FRAP data, including:
  1. Standardization and visualization >The package enables the standardization and plotting of fluorescence data obtained from FRAP experiments, allowing users to gain insights into the dynamics of fluorophore recovery.
  2. Parametric model fitting >It offers tools to fit parametric models to the fluorescence recovery curve, aiding in the identification of the most suitable model that describes the recovery kinetics after photobleaching.
  3. Statistical comparison >The package includes statistical tests to compare fluorescence recovery curves between two different datasets, providing a means to assess significant differences in recovery kinetics.
  4. Simulation methods >Users can utilize simulation methods within the package to increase the effective sample size of their data, enabling more robust statistical analyses and enhancing the accuracy of their conclusions.
